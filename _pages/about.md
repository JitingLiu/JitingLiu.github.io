# About Me
Hi there üëã I am Jiting Liu, currently a research assistant at Microsoft Research Asia, advised by [Prof. Lili Qiu](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/liliqiu/). My research interests are around ubiquitous and mobile computing, specifically exploring wearable sensors and sensor-based system development.

I received my master's degree in Computer Science from Columbia University, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Xia Zhou](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~xia/). I received my bachelor‚Äòs degree in Computer Science from Northeastern University (China) in 2022.
